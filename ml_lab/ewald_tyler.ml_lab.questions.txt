Lab Questions
=======================
1. val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list

2. takes a list of int values and adds one to each element in the list

3. (*a*) defines a function f that takes a list [] and returns the list

4. (*b*) adds one to each element in the list passed into function f.

5. `isMember "one" ["1", "2", "3", "4"]` returns False

6. My isMember function uses tail recursion.

7. { best times, it was the worst of times }


8. Tail recursion executes slightly faster since it doesn't
   require stack push/pop

9. { green eggs and ham }

10. { and macaroni }

11. I like how sml interacts with the interpreter. When you're typing code, the
    interpreter immediately interacts with it and you can see the output as it
    is running.

12. I don't like how sml functions when you use it via command lines. It's much
    easier to to write out the program in a file and then run it and I think
    that should be the standard.

13. I've never used a meta-language before, so learning the syntax and how then
    functions run and connect with each other was really interesting. I disliked
    how clustered the output was when you ran a function though. I feel like
    there was a lot of junk that printed out that was unnecessary.

14. I spent about a couple hours on it every night for the past week, so
    roughly 10 hours.


15. I don't see myself using ML ever again, unless I have to for a job. It's a
    good tool to know, but sml lacks in some aspects like IDE, code
    documentation, and debugging.
